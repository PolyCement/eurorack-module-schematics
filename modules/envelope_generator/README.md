# "another shape" - adsr envelope generator module

## description

adsr envelope generator mostly based on
[rené schmitz' "fastest envelope in the west"](https://www.schmitzbits.de/adsr.html), but with a few extra features inspired by other envelope generators:
- fast/slow switch and manual trigger inspired by [yves usson's yusynth adsr](http://yusynth.net/Modular/EN/ADSR/index_latest.html)
- indicator led inspired by [mki x erica synths' "edu diy eg"](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-eg/)

i considered trying to add a loop function based on the one shown [here](https://github.com/m0xpd/ADSR) but decided against it since i'd already added a bunch of extra stuff already. it's designed as an extension of the yusynth design but i think it could probably be adapted to work with a feitw-based design? maybe i'll try it some day...
